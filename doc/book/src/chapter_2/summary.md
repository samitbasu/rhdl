# Chapter 2 - A Simple Xor Gate

We will walk through the process of building and testing a simple Xor gate.  This is the simplest possible asynchronous circuit, and contains no internal sub-components.  But in the process, we can learn much about RHDL, including how to test and synthesize the resulting circuits.

/// An AXI channel is a simple handshake based mechanism to transfer data from one
/// point to another.  The data itself can be anything, so we model that as generic.
/// The data is transferred in a single direction using a pair of handshake signals.
/// The channel sender and the channel receiver both run state machines to manage the
/// handshake.  In order to be flexible, the channel sender and receiver do not include
/// internal buffers.  Buffering is handled by the user of the channel.

//! AXI Stream Types
//!
//! The AXI Stream is completely equivalent to the
//! `rhdl` Stream concept.  The only difference
//! is that the AXI Stream interface breaks
//! out the valid signal from the data to be processed.
//!
//! This module provides some lightweight cores
//! (combinatorial only) to interface AXI streams
//! to `rhdl` streams and visa versa.

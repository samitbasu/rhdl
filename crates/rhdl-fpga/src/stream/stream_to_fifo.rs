//! A Stream-to-FIFO buffer
//!
//!# Purpose
//! A Stream-to-FIFO buffer is a highly specialized two element
//! FIFO backed with a pair of registers instead of a BRAM.  
//! Note that a FIFO cannot be interfaced to a stream by
//! simply setting `ready = !full`.  This is because the FIFO
//! interface contract says that setting `data = Some(_)` when
//! `full = true` leads to an overflow. The particular use of this
//! [StreamToFIFO] buffer is to minimize the number of resources
//! needed.  As it only requires a couple of registers, it is generally
//! far less resource intensive than a full FIFO.
//!
//!# Schematic Symbol
//!
//! Here is the schematic symbol for the [StreamToFIFO] buffer

//!
//!# Internals
//!
//! Effectively, the [StreamToFIFO] buffer is simply a 2-element FIFO.
//! It is implemented with a pair of registers and manual control logic,
//! since the general FIFO logic doesn't work with such small sizes.
//!
//! Roughly the internal circuitry is equivalent to this:
//!
#![doc = badascii!("
     ?T       +----+FIFO+----+ ?T  
+------------>|data      data+---->
  Ready<T>    |              |     
<-----+! <----+full      next|<---+
              +--------------+     
")]
//! Unlike the general FIFOs, it will not overflow, as it assumes that the
//! data signal will be held until the `Ready` signal is provided.  This is
//! different from normal FIFOs, which will overflow under those conditions.
//!  The FIFO will signal that it is `ready` as long as it is not `full`.
//! The consumer can use the `next` signal to accept the current `data`
//! element.
//!
//! Note that there are no combinatorial paths between the inputs and
//! outputs, and a test is used to verify this property.
//!
//!# Example
//!
//! Here is an example of the buffer in action.

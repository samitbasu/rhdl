//! A FIFO-to-Stream buffer
//!
//!# Purpose
//! A FIFO-to-Stream buffer is a highly specialized two element FIFO backed with a pair
//! of registers instead of a BRAM.  The idea is to allow logic that has "push" semantics
//! like a FIFO interface, to connecto to stream, which has "pull" semantics.  Both
//! interfaces support backpressure (the FIFO via the `full` signal, and the stream via
//! the `ready` signal).
//!
//! The other way to conceptualize this is as a source and sink pair.  The supply side
//! pipeline is a data source - it produces data elements at it's own pace.  The demand
//! side pipeline is a data sink - it consumes data elements at it's own pace.  The push
//! pull buffer in general would be a FIFO, and indeed the Carloni papers show FIFOs as
//! the implementation of push-pull buffers.  However, in many cases, we only need minimal
//! buffering, and a pair of registers is sufficient.  
//!
//! Note that a normal synchronous FIFO as included in `rhdl` will not work here - if it has
//! only two slots in it, it cannot (by design) fill both slots.
//!
//! The design of the buffer uses a state to manage the fill level, and uses the extra
//! value of a fill level of 3 to indicate that the push-pull buffer is in an error condition
//! due to overflow of the input.  To make this buffer easy to use with Carloni
//! skid buffers, the output is presented as an `Option<T>`, and underflow is not possible,
//! as `None` is returned when the buffer is empty.
//!
//! Note that one use case for the [FIFOToStream] buffer is when we need to be able to
//! anticipate by a clock cycle that a pipeline is able to push data forward.  Here is
//! an example of the problem:
//!

")]
//!
//! During the time `t1`, the downstream pipeline was available for us to push a new data item,
//! but our upstream process was not ready.  In time `t2`, the downstream pipeline is no longer
//! available, but the upstream process has produced a data item.  The upstream process must
//! stall and hold this output value until the downstream pipeline re-raises `ready` for a clock
//! cycle.
//!
//! With the [FIFOToStream] buffer, we have an addition invariant:
//!   - A FIFO that is not `full` on cycle `T` cannot be full on cycle `T+1` if we do not add data to it.
//!
//! This invariant means that the equivalent timing diagram with a [FIFOToStream] buffer
//! looks like this instead
//!

//!
//! The important difference is that if the input stage is `!full`, as happens in interval `t1`, the
//! upstream pipeline is guaranteed to be able to run and produce a data item, even if it is in the
//! future.  Thus, if the upstream pipeline waits for the output to be `!full`, it can gaurantee that
//! one output item can be produced.

//!# Internals
//!
//! Effectively, the [FIFOToStream] buffer is simply a 2-element FIFO.  It is implemented with
//! a pair of registers and manual control logic, since the general FIFO logic does not handle
//! such small sizes well.
//!
//! Roughly the internal circuitry is equivalent to this:
//!
#![doc = badascii!(r"

     +--------------+        +-------+
")]
//! The FIFO is advanced only if the output is `Some`, and if the `ready` signal is asserted.
//!
//! Note that there are no combinatorial paths between the inputs and
//! outputs, and a test is used to verify this property.
//!
//!# Example
